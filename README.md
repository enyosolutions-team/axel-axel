Axel (like Axel Foley or a fusion word between Accelerate and express) is a framework based on express. image

## History
This repository started with the team at [Enyosolutions](https://www.enyosolutions.com) building backoffices that were quite similar.
I realised that we were spending too much time to implement features that should have been easy and repetitive (think display a list of data from the api in a table, and interact with it).

We found a few awesome libraries that were great a doing their part, but not necessarly at working together.
Also each needed a lot of configuration (parameters) for each page.

Hence we decided to improve our workflow with various ready to use components.

## features

- Build a back office in a single day.
- Connect to an existing REST api and start working.
- Import and export data to Excel easily.
- Display table and edit their contents easily.
- Link objects with their foreign counterpart easily (foreign key support, nested tab support).
