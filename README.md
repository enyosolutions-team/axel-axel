# Axel framework
Axel (like Axel Foley or a fusion word between Accelerate and express) is a framework based on express. image

## History
This repository started with the team at [Enyosolutions](https://www.enyosolutions.com) building backoffices that were quite similar.
I realised that we were spending too much time to implement features that should have been easy and repetitive (think display a list of data from the api in a table, and interact with it).

We found a few awesome libraries that were great a doing their part, but not necessarly at working together.
Also each needed a lot of configuration (parameters) for each page.

Hence we decided to improve our workflow with various ready to use components.

## features
Build a back office in a single day.
Connect to an existing REST api and start working.
Import and export data to Excel easily.
Display table and edit their contents easily.
Link objects with their foreign counterpart easily (foreign key support, nested tab support).
